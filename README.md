# Next.js 15: getServerSideProps and next-auth Session Inconsistencies

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using `getServerSideProps` with `next-auth` in Next.js 15.  The problem arises when navigating between pages where one page fetches session data via `getServerSideProps` and uses the `unstable_getServerSession` function from `next-auth`. Inconsistent session behavior or rendering errors can occur.  Specifically, the session might not be properly populated on the second page (the page navigated to), even if the user is logged in.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to the `/about` page via the link on the homepage.
5. Observe whether the session is correctly displayed on the `/about` page. Inconsistent behavior may indicate the described issue. 

## Potential Solutions

* **Switching to `getServerSidePaths`:**  Explore using `getServerSidePaths` instead of `getServerSideProps` to pre-render pages based on URL parameters.
* **Re-Fetching Session Data:** The `about.js` file might need to refetch the session data using a client-side approach rather than relying solely on the `getServerSideProps` data.
* **Contextual Issues:**  Carefully examine the context object passed to `getServerSideProps` to ensure it's correctly populated and contains all necessary information for the authentication process.  
* **Ensure NextAuth Config Correctness:** Double-check that your NextAuth configuration (`authOptions` and the overall setup) is accurate and follows best practices.  This includes verifying callbacks and database interaction.
* **Next.js Version:** Verify that your Next.js version is up-to-date, as potential fixes could be included in newer releases.
